## General Information
Complete an analysis using a fictional company's employment data found in 6 csv files. I pulled the employees' information, department managers' information, department number for each employee, list of all employees whose first name is Hercules and whose last name starts with the letter B, a list of all the Sales employees, a list of all Sales and Development  employees and the frequency counts for employee last names.  Using Postgresql, I defined the tables with data types, references and constraints, and imported the data from the csv files. I also created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).

## Technologies Used
- Postgresql
- Pgadmin
- QuickDatabaseDiagrams: https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/


## Screenshots

## Setup
Csv files used in this research is located in the 'data' folder.  Sql queries and schematas for the research are labeled as 'queries' and 'schematas'.  An image of the data modeling also provided.


## Usage
The sql codes below will display the tables with the required information for the analysis.

```
-- QUERY for a list of the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee
	-- USING JOIN
SELECT
	e.emp_no,
	e.last_name,
	e.first_name,
	e.sex,
	s.salary

JOIN salaries s
ON e.emp_no = s.emp_no
ORDER BY e.emp_no;

	-- USING SUBQUERY
SELECT
	emp_no,
	last_name,
	first_name,
	sex,
	(
		SELECT emp_no
		FROM salaries s
		WHERE e.emp_no = s.emp_no
	)
FROM employees e
ORDER BY e.emp_no


-- QUERY for a list of the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986
SELECT

FROM dept_emp de
ORDER BY de.dept_no, last_name


-- QUERY for a list of first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B

ORDER BY last_name;


-- QUERY for a list of each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name
	-- USING JOIN
SELECT
